There are many viewing apps, such as yelp, fork. However, none of those apps contains the viewing of snacks. For example, if customers go to a supermarket and faced countless types of snacks: chips, biscuit, cookie… they may not know all of them well. By using SnackChat, the app we proposed, each unique bar code represents a type of snack (which means the same snack has the same barcode, this is applied in real life). Users could scan the barcode on the snack or search by name and see other people’s comment on this snack. Besides, user could also search the name and type of snacks. The interesting part is that we have an ingredient entity, it could help optimizing the search by not showing sancks that contain user’s hate/allergic ingredient, which could be applied in the application level.
